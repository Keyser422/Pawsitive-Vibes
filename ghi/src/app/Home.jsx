                            Pawsitive Vibes Dog Training LLC was founded in June of 2022
                            because it is never too late to
                            teach an old pet new behaviors. Our tailor-made
                            services are designed with you and your pet in mind
                            to ensure results in a force/fear free manner. We
                            believe in working as much with you as with your
                            pet. Our high success rates and client satisfaction
                            is our greatest source of pride!
