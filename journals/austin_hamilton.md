### Austin's Journal

## 4.12.20204
Our group focused on wireframing and discussed the operational framework of the application. We also set up our repository in GitLab.

## 4.15.2024
Today, we deliberated on the structure of our SQL tables and the design of our endpoints. I began working on initiating some service endpoints and making them functional.

## 4.18.2024
Mostly done with my API endpoints, after having to spend some time debugging today and yesterday, and looking forward to starting on the front end. Luckily, we are creating this website for someone Kyle personally knows, so we have almost a blueprint for how we want to set up our components. 

## 4.22.2024
Over the weekend, Grace worked on starting up our frontend and finalizing the user/auth side of our project. Today I will be working on a form to create services.

## 4.23.2024
Today I worked on creating a form for services
Resolved some merge conflicts
Got started on the service list as well

## 4.24.2024
Completed the service form and got it merged into main so everyone has access
Starting on the service list and detail

## 4.26.2024

I completed my service list and update component, however I still need to work out a few bugs. I'm having trouble grabbing the service id needed to update the component, and where i want to implement the update component itself. Also after the merge yesterday, I needed to change a few things in my form and list component because of database changes.

## 4.27.2024

Still having some trouble with my update component. Im looking into a way to have a link on my list of services to the update component, to see if it can grab the id better. 

## 4.30.2024

Successfully finalized the update form and focused on CSS styling to maintain consistency across the application. While heavily relying on Bootstrap, I created custom CSS files as well. Grateful for Grace's expertise in CSS.

## 5.2.2024

Grace implelemted EmailJs which is super awesome, and I started working one of my strech goals, Calendly. Today was mostly just research on how I want to implement Calendly into our website.

## 5.3.2024

Kyle and I decided to take away the detail view for my service list, mostly because it was redundant. We spent most of the morning-early afternoon debugging and deciding where to go from here. 

## 5.5.2024

Created a Calendly account and added a link to schedule appointments from the service list. You must be a logged in user in order to request an appointment, and simply added the link was too difficult at all. I'm going to start looking into how to interact with Calendly's api, so that hopefully our users can see their upcoming appointments from their profiles.

## 5.8.2024

The Calendly API ended up being way more of a strech goal than I inittially thought, becuase there is a bunch of authorazion that needs to happen, other than just getting the API. We all decided I can work on that after the projects deadline, because even without it, our website is still fully functional. Today I also created some more unit testing, and dealt with a million pipeline errors.
